bmake README
*************

This is the make program used by some of the *BSDs, and the one expected by
elftoolchain, the non-GNU binutils I am attempting to use for this system.

Since I am also not using gcc, bmake needs a special set of definitions to
fit the compiler I am using. I have started out using TCC, so I currently
have two include files: one for tcc in the initial toolchain used to build
linOS, and another for the actual linOS system. Just copy the appropriate
version to bmake/mk/sys/Linux.mk, replacing the file the is already there.
Hopefully this works!
